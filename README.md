It contains various helpers refined through years of practical development, including an elegant logger, an environment variable manager, a path helper, database interfaces, file and media processing, and various other helpers that make common tasks a little easier or more joyful. Developed for personal use, but always to high standards of quality and flexibility.

**Note:** This library is constantly evolving, so for stability you may want to pin specific versions for now. I try to be careful about breaking changes but development is still very active.
